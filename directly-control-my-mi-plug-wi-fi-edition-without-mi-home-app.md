# Directly control my Mi-Plug\(Wi-Fi Edition\) without Mi Home App

Lately  I bought a Smart Adapter from XiaoMi, what depressed me is that I can only control my Mi-Plug through Mi Home App. I just want to control that adapter directly through some scripts or whaterver else , so I search the Internet and finally , after SO MANY disappointment , I got the token and it's time to record it !

### 1.Install a specifi version of the Mi Home App \(5.4.63\)

Maybe some other versions can also get toekn through APP directly, try it as your wish
